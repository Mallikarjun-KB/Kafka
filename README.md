Collection of Pig scripts that I use for solving the code challenge.

The following are the files that are present in this repository.

Data folder contains the two input files i.e. ccds1.csv, ccds2.tsv.
code-challenge.pig - This Pig script is used to load the Data files and solve the challenge. 
FilterDataset folder contains the final output in the file part-r-00000 

Note: The file locations have to be changed accordingly in the code-challenge.pig file.
